Week of 11/14/2023

Main Decisions:
We decided to create a more detailed page with all of the pet info, that can be clicked on to view more info.
Admin accounts and controls are going to be put into the icebox until and if we have time.

Roles for the upcoming week:
Yash - Pet Page
Lucy and Vince - Explore Page, (boulder and anywhere)
Lindy - Filters
Andrew - Profile page and updating profile. 
Matt- My Posts and Post Pets. 

Filters need to change based on pet type.
The Boulder explore page needs to be updated to display images correctly and have same format as explore anywhere.
User profile pages needs to have edit features. 
My Posts and Posts Pets routes need fixing. 
Individual Pet pages need to be created to display all info and choices for the pet specified.
