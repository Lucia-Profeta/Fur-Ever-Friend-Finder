## Application Name  
(Fur-ever Friend Finder)

## Application Description  
 Our application will allow people to search for pets and place adoption applications. The website will have a search menu with filters, such as Cat/Dog, breed, color, etc. This will allow users to narrow down their search to find their desired pet. Users will be able to favorite animals they are interested in adoptin and can view them from their profile. The website will have a log in function, that will allow a user to store all of their information that would be needed for an application. This way, users can place an adoption application without filling out a form with their information. The aplication is stored in a database. They can see which applications they have submitted. Users can also post animals for adoption.  

## Vision Statement  
For animal lovers who want to find a new best friend. NAME_ is a website that allows people to search for animals, submit adoption applications, and post pets for adoption. Unlike petfinder, our website allows users to post pet adoption profiles.
